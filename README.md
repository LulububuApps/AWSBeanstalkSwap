# AWSBeanstalkSwap

A configuration file for your amazon elastic beanstalk that automatically sets up a swap after you first deployment.

## Installation

Just download the source code and copy the `swap.config` into your `.ebextensions` folder. The final path may be `your-app-root/.ebextensions/swap.config`.

Everything should work out of the box.
